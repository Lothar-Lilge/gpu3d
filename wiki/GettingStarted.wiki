This tutorial aims to guide new users through the process of setting up and running our software.

== Step 1: Check your graphics card == 
----
Before you start, make sure that your graphics card is CUDA compatible (check Appendix A of the [http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/3_0/toolkit/docs/NVIDIA_CUDA_ProgrammingGuide.pdf CUDA programming guide]) and has a Compute Capability of between 1.1 and 2.0 (Fermi).  Note that atomic instructions are only supported on devices with a Compute Capability of at least 1.1.  Most graphics cards today should be in this category.

If you don't have a proper graphics card or if you want the best performance from our code, we recommend purchasing the latest Fermi-generation GPU, such as [http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_gtx_480_us.html GeForce GTX 480].  However, ensure that your power supply is at least 600 W (with 6-pin & 8-pin power connectors) and the motherboard supports PCI-E 2.0 x 16.  

== Step 2: Install CUDA, Developer Drivers, and SDK Samples ==
----
Then, just follow all the steps in the [http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/3_0/docs/GettingStartedWindows.pdf NVIDIA Getting Started Guide].  

If you have a Fermi GPU, install [http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_0_downloads.html CUDA ToolKit 3.0 and GPU Computing SDK code samples] along with the proper Developer Drivers.  *Make sure you upgrade both the driver and the CUDA Toolkit, and not one of the two!  Otherwise, the code will not run !*

== Step 3: Verify the steps above ==
----
Make sure you have everything set up properly, by running a simple SDK code sample, as suggested in the [http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/3_0/docs/GettingStartedWindows.pdf NVIDIA Getting Started Guide] 

== Step 4: Download our software package ==
----
Download and unarchive: [http://gpu3d.googlecode.com/files/gpu3d_win32.zip GPU3D]

== Step 5: Run a simple test ==
----

*Note: The current release is tuned specifically for GTX 280, GTX 295, and GTX 480 (Fermi).  Older graphics cards may not have enough resources to launch the program.* 

====_For Windows Users Only_====
  # Run the program by double-clicking *gpu3d.exe*
  # Enter the input file name: *liver.mci*

To scroll through the slices (xy, yz, xz planes), press *1, 2; 3, 4; or 5, 6*.
 
To rotate, press *q, w; a, s; or z, x* (to rotate around the x, y, and z axes). 

== (Optional) Step 6: Plot the simulation output with MATLAB ==
----
Use the MATLAB script (*plotslice.m*) to plot the output or to parse the simulation output file (*liver_20M.mco_node_1*) for further analysis.
